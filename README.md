# AlgoGraphix

Interactive visualizer of path-finding and graph algorithms in the browser.

## About

AlgoGraphix is a visual, interactive web application for exploring various graph- and path-finding algorithms. It allows users to:

- Create a grid of nodes
- Set a start node and end node
- Add walls (obstacles), weighted nodes, and stations
- Visualize how different algorithms traverse the grid and find shortest paths
- Interactively modify nodes during execution (e.g., moving start/end)
- See animations / steps of the algorithm

## Features

- **Grid-based visualization**
- **Supports user interaction:**
  - Add/remove walls
  - Add weighted nodes
  - Add “station” nodes (extra feature)
  - Move start / end / station nodes
- **Multiple algorithms** (to be listed, if known)
- **Smooth animations** and step-by-step feedback
- **Responsive UI** disabling user interactions while the algorithm is running or during grid generation to avoid state conflicts.
